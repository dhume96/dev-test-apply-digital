## Apply Digital Back End Developer Test

My name is Daniel Hume and I am really excited to be able to apply to the JavaScript position. This is a repo for the test which has a NestJS API with all the requirements from the PDF file.

I developed the API using NestJS, MongoDB with Mongoose as the ORM and Swagger. I also used Docker so the application and the database can be run using docker-compose.

## Running The Application

Clone the repo for the API and run docker-compose in the same directory as the project root:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dhume96/dev-test-apply-digital.git
docker-compose up -d
```

This should create a container with both the server and the database and it should start them, in order to check that both are running the following command can be run:

```bash
docker ps
```

which should show both running:

## Postman Collection

A postman collection called `Dev-Test-Apply-Digital.postman_collection.json` is included in the root of the project. It can be imported directly into Postman and will include the requests for all the endpoints in the API.

## Generating a token to test the private endpoints

In order to consume the 3 reports endpoints a token must be generated and sent in the headers. The following endpoint can be used for this:

```bash
curl --location 'localhost:4000/auth/login' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "username": "name"
}'

```

Note: This request is also un the Postman collection
